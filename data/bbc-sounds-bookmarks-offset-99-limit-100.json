He was privately educated at Westminster School and read History at Oxford, graduating with a first. He moved to the USA where he was introduced to the American documentary maker Michael Moore and started making segments on unusual subcultures for Moore’s show TV Nation. He was given his own series – Louis Theroux’s Weird Weekends – by the BBC in the late 1990s and, after three series, he went on to present two series of When Louis Met…, which included Neil and Christine Hamilton, Max Clifford, Chris Eubank and Jimmy Savile. \n\nSince then, he has made dozens of documentaries, many of them in the USA. In 2016, he revisited his encounters with Jimmy Savile in the wake of Savile’s death and the surfacing of allegations of child sexual abuse. The same year, his only feature-length film, My Scientology Movie, was released. His most recent documentaries dealt with sexual assault on American campuses, mothers with post-natal mental illness, and escorting.\n\nBOOK CHOICE: Remembrance of things Past – Marcel Proust \nLUXURY: 40,000 piece Jigsaw puzzle\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: “Heaven on their Minds” from the album Jesus Christ Superstar\n\nPresenter:  Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Cathy Drysdale"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p078h5g5.jpg","duration":{"value":3078,"label":"51 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

But his early promise on the water was scuppered by a bout of glandular fever - so he's had to make do instead with life as a worldwide entertainment superstar.\n\nVery British comedy, very big budget movies, very successful syndicated TV drama - his 30 year career has taken him from A Little Bit of Fry & Laurie to a big bit of broadcasting history: his role in the U.S. show House ran for 8 series and had a global audience of 81 million. So why now does he feel the need to risk his stellar reputation by making music too? \n\nHe says, \"as soon as I acknowledge to myself that something is frightening and carries the risk of public humiliation I feel like I have to do it.\"\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01jyjrx.jpg","duration":{"value":2700,"label":"45 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

He believes that too many people have no sense of their true talents and passions, and his internationally renowned talks to teachers, business and government leaders argue that - contrary to popular myth - creativity and innovation can be developed in a deliberate and systematic way. What we need, he thinks, is a learning revolution.\n\nHis own erudition began in a crowded house on Merseyside in the fifties, full of visitors, noise and laughter. His front door was just a hundred yards from Everton football club, but his boyhood dreams of playing for The Blues ended when he contracted polio.\n\nThe first of his six siblings to pass the 11-plus and win a scholarship to one of Liverpool's best schools, his education would fundamentally shape the rest of his life. He says \"If a teacher hadn't seen something in me that I hadn't seen in myself, my life might have gone in a very different direction.\"\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p01lb0hf.jpg","duration":{"value":2700,"label":"45 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?
