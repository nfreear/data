She is one of the most senior women in the Fire and Rescue Service in the UK. \n\nAfter spending some time living on the streets as a teenager, her work as a firefighter began at the age of 18, after she had applied to 31 different fire services. During her career, her interest in psychology and fascination with how people make choices in stressful situations led to her studying for a degree, followed by a PhD. Her research into risk, decision-making under extreme pressure and human error has won awards and she has shared her findings with fire services in other countries. \nShe is also an ambassador for The Big Issue magazine, in the wake of her own experiences of homelessness.\n\nDISC ONE: Alicia Keys - Girl on Fire\nDISC TWO: J Balvin and Willy William - Mi Gente\nDISC THREE: The Clash - Bankrobber  \nDISC FOUR: IDLES - Samaritans   \nDISC FIVE: Sex Pistols - Anarchy in the UK  \nDISC SIX: Oasis - Don’t Look Back in Anger  \nDISC SEVEN: Stereophonics - Local Boy in the Photograph  \nDISC EIGHT: Toots and the Maytals - 54-46 Was My Number\n \nBOOK CHOICE: The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway\nLUXURY ITEM: A photo album\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE:  Bankrobber by The Clash\n\nPresenter:  Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Sarah Taylor"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p07p4x28.jpg","duration":{"value":3139,"label":"52 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?
