Known both for his solo work and for his comedic collaborations with, among others, Rob Newman and Frank Skinner, he has also written a screenplay, a musical and several books. Born in 1964 to Jewish parents, the second of three boys, he was brought up in Dollis Hill, London. His father was a scientist from Swansea and his mother was a refugee, whose family had to flee from Nazi Germany. When David was 13, his older brother Ivor played him sketches by Derek and Clive which kindled his appetite to become a comedian. \n\nHe read English at Cambridge and became vice-president of the Footlights before starting out on the London comedy circuit. Together with Steve Punt, Hugh Dennis and Rob Newman, he was part of The Mary Whitehouse Experience for Radio 1 and later BBC 2. Rob and David went on to create Newman and Baddiel in Pieces, and were the first comedians to sell out Wembley Arena with a gig in 1993, prompting newspapers to declare comedy \"the new rock 'n' roll\". David then formed a comedy partnership with Frank Skinner and they hosted Fantasy Football League and later Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned. They co-wrote the lyrics to one of the best-known football songs, Three Lions.\n\nIn 2005, David took a break from performance and concentrated on writing novels for adults and children's books as well as the script for a film, which became a musical, The Infidel. He returned to stand-up in 2013 with a show about fame. He recently mined his parents' idiosyncrasies and the rare form of dementia from which his father suffers for a stand-up show entitled My Family: Not the Sitcom. His partner is fellow comedian and writer Morwenna Banks.

He briefly joined the family farm, but left to become a management consultant in London and then New York, returning to the farm in 1986. He started cultivating vegetables on three acres of land with a wheelbarrow and a borrowed tractor, and found his niche, moving from three to 18 to 50 acres quite rapidly. \n\nInitially, Guy sold to supermarkets, but became convinced that there must be a better way of getting his produce to customers, and set up a veg box scheme in 1993. His company now delivers to around 50,000 homes a week and had a turnover of £56.7 million in 2017.\nGuy has four grown-up children from his first marriage and an eight-year-old step-daughter from his second marriage to Geetie Singh.\n\nPresenter: Kirsty Young\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06bqrjz.jpg","duration":{"value":2322,"label":"38 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

She discovered tennis at the age of ten: at 15 she won in her age bracket at the Southern California championships, and in 1961, she won the women's doubles at Wimbledon with Karen Hantze, the youngest pair to achieve such a victory. \n\nIn 1968, when professional competitors were admitted to Grand Slam tournaments, she won Wimbledon for the third time and was paid just £750 while Rod Laver, the Men's champion, took home £2,000. So began her campaign for gender equality, which involved boycotting tournaments and setting up their own professional women's circuit. In 1973, then aged 29, she beat the 55-year-old former tennis champion Bobby Riggs in a match which became known as 'The Battle of the Sexes': it remains the most-watched tennis match ever. That year the US Open awarded the same financial reward to men and women and in 2007 Wimbledon followed suit. Billie Jean also founded the Women's Tennis Association and the Women's Sports Foundation in the 1970s.\n\nShe married her husband, Larry, in 1965 but by the late 1960s, she had realised that she was gay. She was outed by a former lover who sued her for palimony in 1981, and although she won the case, she lost almost all her commercial endorsements. She has been with her partner, Ilana Kloss, for nearly 40 years and retired from singles matches in 1983 and doubles in 1990. She was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2009 and has continued to be an ambassador for her sport and for gender equality.\n\nPresenter: Kirsty Young\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale."},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06dnvrw.jpg","duration":{"value":3472,"label":"57 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

Drugs played a part in Nile's life too from an early age, and he took his first acid trip with Timothy Leary at the age of 15.  After learning to play the guitar, he got his musical break touring with the Sesame Street stage show and playing in the house band of Harlem’s Apollo Theatre, where he met bassist Bernard Edwards with whom he developed a productive musical partnership and went on to found Chic.   \n\nFollowing the Disco Sucks movement of the late 1970s, Nile and Bernard turned to production, and sprinkled their magic dust on Sister Sledge and Diana Ross.  When Nile and Bernard went their separate ways in the early 1980s, Nile forged ahead on his own, working with, among others, Madonna, Michael Jackson, David Bowie and Duran Duran.\n\nNile went into rehab in 1994 and has been clean and sober for the past 24 years and has received successful treatment for cancer twice. He won three Grammys for his 2013 collaboration with the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, and has recently released the first Chic album in 26 years.\n\nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06n0z90.jpg","duration":{"value":3520,"label":"58 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

This work eventually secured Venki a Nobel Prize in 2009, which he shared with Ada Yonath and Thomas Steitz. \n\nVenki was born in Tamil Nadu, in the south of India. Both his parents were scientists, and both pursued postgraduate studies overseas when Venki was very young. He completed his schooling in India, and then moved to the United States. Life on an American campus in the early 1970s was, he recalls, a culture shock for a self-confessed nerdy young Indian. He completed a PhD in Physics in 1976, but then switched to biology which he felt was a more exciting discipline. His research into the ribosome began when he was working at Yale as a post-doctoral fellow in the late 1970s. \n\nHe moved to the UK in 1999, joining the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge as a group leader. He was knighted in 2012, and has served as President of the Royal Society since 2015, where he has argued that science should enjoy a central place in the curriculum and in our wider culture. \n\n\nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer: Sarah Taylor"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06p2flt.jpg","duration":{"value":2406,"label":"40 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

At the age of 10, he saw Depeche Mode on Top of the Pops, prompting the desire to take to the stage himself. He wrote A Million Love Songs, which later became a Top 10 hit for Take That, in his bedroom when he was 15. By this time he was a regular performer in a Labour club just across the Welsh border, where he cut his teeth playing the organ and singing. \n\nBy the time he was 18, he was so good at writing songs that he successfully auditioned for a place in the group which became Take That. They went on to be one of the most successful bands of all time, winning a devoted audience with tracks such as Back For Good, Everything Changes and Pray. When they broke up in early 1996, helplines were set up to assuage their fans’ feelings of loss and grief. In 2005, Take That reformed, with Robbie Williams rejoining them for a spell in 2010, and – in some form or other – the band has kept going and will tour again in 2019.\n\nGary was put in charge of organising the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee concert and performed at the closing ceremony for the London Olympics in 2012.

His father was a chemical engineer while his mother taught English and later worked at the post office in their home town of Rochester. Nitin showed early musical promise when he took up the piano aged five, later also learning flamenco guitar, sitar and tabla. He was bullied at school at a time when the National Front was gaining traction and music became his sanctuary.\n\nAfter abandoning a law degree at Liverpool and completing an accountancy course in Hertfordshire, he became financial controller of a hotel, before leaving to become a full time musician. While at college, he met Sanjeev Bhaskar and formed a comedy duo with him which would become the radio and TV series, Goodness Gracious Me. \n\nHis breakthrough came with his fourth album, released in 1999, entitled Beyond Skin, which was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. Since then, his career has been in the ascendant: he has established himself as one of the most versatile composers for film, scoring pictures like Midnight’s Children and television programmes including the BBC’s Human Planet series.

After graduating from Harvard, he moved to England to pursue a PhD in physiology at Cambridge and became an expert on salt absorption in the gall bladder. He returned to the USA, and then his travels took him to New Guinea where he developed a passionate interest in ornithology and a lifelong love of the island which he’s continued to visit for the past 50 years.\n\nHe has learned 12 languages, speaking several of them fluently, and has published six books and hundreds of articles.

Judith Kerr escaped with her family on the day the Nazis were elected. The following day, police turned up at the doorstep in a belated attempt to confiscate their passports. The Kerr family moved across Europe, trying to support themselves and escape from the nearing threat, until they eventually settled in England in 1936. The family stayed in London throughout the war; surviving the Blitz and in fear of invasion. Judith Kerr wrote an autobiographical trilogy about her experiences and the books - in particular When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit - have been used ever since as a way of explaining to children the horrors of the Nazi threat. Today, they are set texts in many German schools.\n\nShe was always a keen painter but had never thought it could be a career; it was only when she had two children who enjoyed the tales she told that she decided to try her hand at picture books. Her first book, The Tiger Who Came to Tea, was instantly successful when it was published in 1968 and has never been out of print.

It won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Drama, 11 Tony Awards and Grammy for Best Musical Theatre Album. The London production won seven Olivier Awards in 2018. \n \nLin-Manuel was brought up in New York by his Puerto Rican parents, and his creativity and sensitivity to music began when he was a child: he performed in Gilbert and Sullivan’s Pirates of Penzance as a teenager and created films using his father’s camcorder.  He attended the elite Hunter school for gifted children and spent his summer holidays in Puerto Rico with his extended family. \n\nHis first musical, In the Heights, opened on Broadway in 2008, directed by his long-time collaborator, Thomas Kail. It received four Tony Awards including Best Score as well as a Grammy Award for its Original Broadway Cast Album. Among his TV and film acting credits are Fosse/Verdon, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Mary Poppins Returns, and he is currently filming the second series of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials for the BBC.  He recently collaborated with J.J. Abrams on the song Dobra Doompa, for Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens and he contributed music, lyrics and vocals to several songs in the Disney animated feature film Moana.\n \nLin-Manuel supported the relief efforts in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria in September 2017, performing Hamilton there and raising funds for arts and culture on the island. He co-founded the hip-hop improv group Freestyle Love Supreme in 2003 and they have just begun a debut run on Broadway. \n\nHe lives in New York City with his wife, sons and dog.\n\nDISC ONE: Liza Minelli - Cabaret\nDISC TWO: The Decemberists - The Crane Wife Part 2  \nDISC THREE: Rubén Blades and Seis del Solar - El Padre Antonio y el Monaguillo Andrés \nDISC FOUR: The Pharcyde - Passin’ Me By\nDISC FIVE: Ali Dineen - What You Know\nDISC SIX: Regina Spektor - On the Radio\nDISC SEVEN: Gilberto Santa Rosa - Déjate Querer\nDISC EIGHT: Outkast - Rosa Parks\n\nBOOK CHOICE: Moby-Dick by Herman Melville\nLUXURY ITEM: Coffee\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: What You Know by  Ali Dineen\n\nPresenter:  Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Cathy Drysdale"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p07q4mcx.jpg","duration":{"value":2631,"label":"43 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

An expert in sleep, he describes it as 'the single most important health behaviour we have'. \n\nBorn in 1959, as a child he loved his toy microscope and digging up fossils. Despite being labelled “entirely non-academic” by his headmaster and attending remedial classes for some years, he achieved three science A levels which won him a place at the University of Bristol.\n\nThere, he developed an early interest in photo-receptors - cells which convert light into signals that can stimulate biological processes. This eventually led to his post-doctoral discovery, in 1991, of a previously unknown type of cell – photosensitive retinal ganglion cells – in the eyes of mice. His proposition that these ganglion cells – which are not used for vision, but to detect brightness – exist in humans too initially met with scepticism from the ophthalmological community. \n\nRussell’s research has made a significant impact, proving that our eyes provide us with both our sense of vision and our sense of time, which has changed the clinical definition of blindness and the treatment of eye disease.  He has published several popular science books.\n\nRussell is married to Elizabeth Downes, with whom he has three grown-up children.\n\nDISC ONE: Ode to Joy from the 4th movement of Symphony No. 9, conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler, performed by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Elisabeth Höngen, Hans Hopf, Otto Edelman and the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra  \nDISC TWO: Die Walkϋre Act 3, Finale, from Der Ring des Nibelungen, sung by Hans Hotter and performed by Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Vienna State Opera Chorus \nDISC THREE: Don Giovanni, K. 527: Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata by Kiri Te Kanawa\nDISC FOUR: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) by Eurythmics\nDISC FIVE: (Nimrod): Adagio by BBC Symphony Orchestra   \nDISC SIX:  Title:  Chasing Sheep Is Best Left To Shepherds by The Michael Nyman Band\nDISC SEVEN: The Mikado, Act II: The Sun Whose Rays by The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company\nDISC EIGHT: Let’s Misbehave by Irving Aaronson \n\nBOOK CHOICE:  The collected works of Adrian John Desmond\nLUXURY ITEM: A mask, snorkel, flippers and underwater camera\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE:  Die Walkϋre Act 3, Finale, from Der Ring des Nibelungen, sung by Hans Hotter and performed by Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Vienna State Opera Chorus\n\nPresenter:  Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Cathy Drysdale"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p07wwqsw.jpg","duration":{"value":2491,"label":"41 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

His biological father had left the family when Ian was under two years old. Things at home were difficult and Ian spent as much time as possible outside playing football.\n\nAt his primary school a teacher, Mr Pigden, took him under his wing and Ian would later credit him with changing his life. He left his secondary school at the age of 14 to get a job.  Although he took part in trials for many professional football clubs as a teenager, he was never selected. He continued to play for amateur sides. By the age of 21, he had three children to provide for, so when Crystal Palace came calling in 1985, he turned them down three times before accepting a two-week trial, followed by a three-month contract.  His football career had finally begun.\n\nAfter impressing as a forward at Palace, he was bought by Arsenal for a record fee in 1991.  He was called up to the England squad the same year and would go on to collect 33 caps. He spent his last couple of years in professional football at a number of clubs around the country and in total, he played 581 league games, scoring 387 goals for seven clubs in England and Scotland. Since his retirement from football in 2000, he has had a career as a pundit on both TV and radio. \n\nHe has eight children and has been happily married to his second wife, Nancy, since 2011.\n\nDISC ONE:  The Marriage of Figaro: Duettino - Sull'aria by Orchestra of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, composed by Lorenzo Da Ponte and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  \nDISC TWO:  Looking For You by Kirk Franklin\nDISC THREE:  River Deep Mountain High by Ike and Tina Turner       \nDISC FOUR: Redemption Song by Bob Marley & The Wailers\nDISC FIVE:  Mysteries of the World by MSFB   \nDISC SIX:  Endlessly by Randy Crawford\nDISC SEVEN:  Crown by Stormzy  \nDISC EIGHT: Just Fine by Mary J Blige\n\nBOOK CHOICE: The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime by Mark Haddon\nLUXURY ITEM: A seven iron golf club and golf balls\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: Endlessly by Randy Crawford\n\nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Cathy Drysdale"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p082ws8z.jpg","duration":{"value":2815,"label":"46 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

It was an immediate hit, with 10 million viewers a week, becoming one of BBC One’s most popular dramas and a fixture in the Christmas schedules. \n\nBorn in 1962, Heidi Thomas grew up as the eldest of three children in the leafy suburbs of Liverpool. Her father ran a drain cleaning business while her mother looked after the children, including Heidi’s youngest brother David, who was born with Down’s Syndrome.\n\nHeidi studied English at Liverpool University, supporting herself by selling ladies’ underwear at a department store. During a bout of viral hepatitis, which left her unable to apply for jobs when she graduated, she entered a competition for new plays and won a prize for her debut, All Flesh is Grass. During the production,of her next play, Shamrocks and Crocodiles, she met the actor Stephen McGann. They went on to marry, and many years later Stephen was cast as the GP in Call the Midwife.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in the theatre, Heidi made the leap into television, first writing on existing series such as Soldier, Soldier and Doctor Finlay. Her other screenwriting credits include Lilies, based on her grandmother’s recollections, and adaptations of classic novels including Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford, Noel Streatfeild’s Ballet Shoes and Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women. \n\nDISC ONE: You Belong to Me by The Duprees  \nDISC TWO: Penny Lane by The Beatles \nDISC THREE: Gentle on my Mind by Dean Martin \nDISC FOUR: Who Will Sing Me Lullabies? by Kate Rusby\nDISC FIVE: The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face by Roberta Flack \nDISC SIX: Finishing The Hat by Josh Groban \nDISC SEVEN: Agnus Dei from Requiem, op. 48, conducted by Nigel Short and performed by London Symphony Orchestra Chamber Ensemble and Tenebrae\nDISC EIGHT: Both Sides, Now by Joni Mitchell \n\nBOOK CHOICE:   London Labour and the London Poor by Henry Mayhew\nLUXURY ITEM:   A hot water bottle\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: Both Sides, Now by Joni Mitchell\n\nPresenter:  Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Sarah Taylor"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p07wwmcw.jpg","duration":{"value":3184,"label":"53 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

She was given the nickname Sporty Spice and presented what she calls a \"gobby' persona to the outside world, but inside she was a shy girl who preferred to stay in the background.  \n\nShe grew up in Merseyside and as a child she loved performing.  At 16 she attended the Doreen Bird College of Arts, aiming for a career in musical theatre. By her early 20s, she was an international star:  Spice world was a high-octane life of constant recording and touring and the accompanying press scrutiny contributed to a stressful environment.  As the pressure intensified Melanie suffered from eating disorders and in 2000 she was diagnosed with depression.  Her recovery was long and painful but she says finally getting a diagnosis enabled her to begin the process of getting better. \n\nWhen the Spice Girls went their separate ways for a while Melanie began a career as a successful solo artist.  In 2009 she played Mrs Johnstone in the West End production of Willy Russell's musical Blood Brothers, earning five star reviews and standing ovations.  Recently she has been back on stage with the Spice Girls on their stadium tour. \n\nDISC ONE: I Wish by Stevie Wonder  \nDISC TWO:  The Chain by Fleetwood Mac\nDISC THREE: Prince Charming by Adam and the Ants\nDISC FOUR:  Into the Groove by Madonna\nDISC FIVE:  Girls and Boys by Blur \nDISC SIX: Everything I Wanted by Billie Eilish\nDISC SEVEN: Heaven on Their Minds by Tim Minchin\nDISC EIGHT: You'll Never Walk Alone by Gerry & The Pacemakers\n\nBOOK CHOICE:  Dancing with Demons: The Authorised Biography of Dusty Springfield by Penny Valentine and Vicki Wickham \nLUXURY ITEM:  A Martin acoustic guitar \nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE:  I Wish by Stevie Wonder \n\nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Paula McGinley"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p083nts7.jpg","duration":{"value":2460,"label":"41 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

He has also appeared on Broadway and in the West End, as well as in over a dozen films since the final part of the Harry Potter series was released in 2011. \n\nBorn in 1989, the only child of Alan and Marcia Radcliffe, Daniel made his acting debut aged 10 in a BBC adaptation of David Copperfield. The following year he was cast as Harry Potter, and he and his co-stars, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, would spend ten years filming the series. Daniel made a point of taking other roles before it had finished, and he appeared on stage in Peter Shaffer’s play Equus in 2007, a role which involved prolonged full frontal nudity. \n\nSince then he has appeared on screen, on stage and on television, playing characters from the beat poet Allen Ginsberg to a cop going undercover as a neo-Nazi, and his recent films include Guns Akimbo and Escape from Pretoria.  In the theatre, he is appearing in Samuel Beckett’s Endgame in London. \n\nHe supports the Trevor Project which works to prevent suicides among LGBTQ youth and which Daniel first became aware of during the Broadway run of Equus in 2008. Daniel has been in a long-term relationship with fellow actor Erin Darke who he met on a film set in 2012.\n\nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Cathy Drysdale"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p086b41q.jpg","duration":{"value":3327,"label":"55 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?

A fellow of the Royal College of Nursing, she spent 40 years in the profession and has been named one of the most influential nurses in the history of the NHS. Her career was distinguished by her pioneering work in the understanding of sickle cell disease - bringing better treatment and support to the thousands living with it. She was the first sickle cell and thalassaemia nurse counsellor in the UK.\n\nHer decades of dedication, care and service are a contrast to her own disrupted childhood as a mixed race child born out of wedlock in the 1940s, though it was the kindness of a nurse when she was just five that sparked a nascent interest in what would become her life’s work. After leaving school at 16, with seven O-levels, Elizabeth was made a Professor of Nursing in 1998.\n\nShe left her day job behind in 2007, but as she puts it “it has not turned out to be a quiet retirement”.  She spent nine years fundraising and campaigning for a statue to British-Jamaican nurse Mary Seacole. Unveiled in 2016 in the grounds of St Thomas’ Hospital, London, the statue is the first in the UK to represent a named black woman. Elizabeth received the DBE in 2017 for services to nursing and the Mary Seacole Statue Appeal.\n\nDISC ONE:  Faith’s Song by Amy Wadge \nDISC TWO:  The Rakes of Mallow, Girl I Left Behind by The Gallowglass Ceili Band\nDISC THREE:  Manman by Leyla McCalla\nDISC FOUR:   A Te,O Cara by Andrea Bocelli\nDISC FIVE:  Missa Bilban by The Jamaican Folk Singers\nDISC SIX:  I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free by Nina Simone\nDISC SEVEN:  Nnekata by Flavour N'abania\nDISC EIGHT:  My Girl by Otis Redding\n  \nBOOK CHOICE: Dreams From My Father by Barack Obama\nLUXURY ITEM: A trampoline\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free by Nina Simone \n \nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer:  Cathy Drysdale"},"image_url":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p08f9mtr.jpg","duration":{"value":2204,"label":"36 mins"},"progress":null,"container":{"type":"brand","id":"b006qnmr","urn":"urn:bbc:radio:brand:b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","synopses":{"short":"Castaway guests share the soundtrack of their lives.","medium":"Eight tracks, a book and a luxury: what would you take to a desert island?
